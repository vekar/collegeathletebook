				“I’ve known Marten for years, and our biggest common denominator is that we know a team’s / athlete’s culture is more important than their talent.  No other book on the market gives a more full-spectrum, all-around approach to building a successful college athlete than <em>Beneath the College Jersey</em>.  My suggestion is for every player on my team to read this, and more importantly, to heed the advice.”
</br></br><em><strong>Mike Daly</strong>, Two-Time Men’s Lacrosse NCAA National Champion Coach</em>

				<div class="columns seven offset-by-one">
				“<em>Beneath the College Jersey</em> is a great resource for both current and aspiring college athletes.  Marten has created a thoughtful analysis of how to be a healthier college athlete.  He presents his premise in a well-written and entertaining fashion, providing a road map for the reader to take necessary steps to a healthier experience.  It changed the way I look at healthy living. It keeps us focused on the big picture!”
</br></br><em><strong>John Casey</strong>, Vice President of the American Baseball Coaches Association</em>

			“Vandervelde has accurately identified lifestyle as the key to success in college sports and has given all athletes an understandable and indispensable guidebook to athletic achievement.  <em>Beneath the College Jersey</em> contains in-dispensable tools for my student-athletes before, during, and after practice, and captures the essentials of healthy and successful athletic training.”
</br></br><em><strong>Brad Snodgrass</strong>, Six-Time Diving NCAA National Champion Coach</em>

			“Marten’s insights in <em>Beneath the College Jersey</em> could be used beyond the spectrum of college athletics — into both the military and business worlds to create a healthy answer to an ongoing issue.  This book is a refreshing take on an overwhelmingly overlooked issue: health in college athletics.  Marten nails it, and produces riveting science, self-help, and entertainment, all in one book.”
</br></br><em><strong>Nick Falk</strong>, 1st Lieutenant United States Army, former collegiate football player</em>

					<h1>About the author</h1>
					<p><strong>Marten J. Vandervelde, CSCS</strong>, is a Strength and Conditioning Coach at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts.  Before his arrival at Tufts, no team had ever won a national championship; within his first four years, Vandervelde primed teams that went on to win the historic first men’s and first women’s national titles.  His acknowledged expertise in the realm of college life outside the gym is what continues to separate the student-athletes that follow his tutelage from the rest of the country.</p>
